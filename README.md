Users is a telephone directory with a lot of functionality:<br/>
- You can create tasks and assign them to a specific employee;<br/>
- In the list of tasks for execution you can "complete/continue" and the task will go to the corresponding list;<br/>
- There is a list of notifications, where you can view all notifications;<br/>
- There is a separate role of a manager, who sees all the tasks in general and who rattles off what (and so you only see yours). And in general he is a king and a god! üòÅ <br/>
- All actions can be performed not only through the interface, but also through SOAP and REST requests.
